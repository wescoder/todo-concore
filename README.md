## Development

Before starting you'll need to install the dependencies with `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn
```

After installing create the environment configuration on the `.env.development` file or `.env.production` if deploying:

```sh
SERVER_PORT=4000
APP_ID='playground'
APP_KEY='<YOUR_API_KEY>'
CONCORE_ADMIN_USER='<YOUR_USERNAME>'
CONCORE_ADMIN_PASSWORD='<YOUR_PASSWORD'
```

After this you should be able to run in production with `npm start` or run locally with `npm run dev`.
